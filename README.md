IoT soil moisture sensor

*WIP*

## General
Built upon the wonderful Adafruit ecosystem, this small project utilizes a ESP8266 WiFi enabled board and a capacitive sensor to monitor soil moisture. It uses MQTT as a message system, sending sensor data to a broker to be processed later (TODO add url to other repos).

## Hardware components
Board: [Adafruit Feather HUZZAH with ESP8266](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2821)    
Sensor: [Adafruit STEMMA Soil Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4026)
